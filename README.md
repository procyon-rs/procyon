Procyon is a declarative statistical visuzualization library for Rust. *This description is directly taken from the very good [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) project.*

This crate build upon [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) specification and support the [version 3](https://github.com/procyon-rs/vega_lite_3) and [version 4](https://github.com/procyon-rs/vega_lite_4) of its sepcification.
Vega-Lite is a high-level grammar of interactive graphics. It provides a concise JSON syntax for rapidly generating visualizations. Vega-Lite specifications can be compiled to [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/)  specifications. Those specifications are then parsed by Vegaâ€™s JavaScript runtime to generate both static images or interactive web-based views.
